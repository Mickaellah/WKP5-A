# Weekend project 5.

**Succesful.**

1. In this project, we created some cards to show each recipe with some details about it. I succeded for doing that and also for the informatio, I get some of the information that we need to show but not all though.

2. I got all the more info buttons in the cards working and show the details as a modal.

3. I got the form working as a modal and also its submit button but the more info button didn't work as it should be.

**Failure.**

The ingredients and steps parts were not working as lists, the were still separated by comma. I failed to make the more info button with the new card that I created form the form working.

**Requirement.**

My project didn't meet the requirements because I couldn't finish parts of it. I tried to use loop with them but the didn't work and I didn't know what method to use to get them working.

**Improvement.**

If I had more time to work on it, I would try to finish the whole requirement, would make some improvement in HTML and CSS skill and also in term of cleanliness and structure.
